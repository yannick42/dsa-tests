# Development

## Create new demo
use `cp _template my-new-demo`
then add the page inside the `/index.html` root file


# Implementation of a spreadsheet using topological sort
> with formulas referencing other cells, eg. `#A3*10`

see example here : https://yannick42.github.io/playground/spreadsheet/

# Snake game in JS
> https://yannick42.github.io/playground/snake/

it reuses the toposort algorithm (DFS in `/common/`) to order neuron calculations
