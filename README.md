# Implementation of a spreadsheet using topological sort
> with formulas referencing other cells, eg. `#A3*10`

see example here : https://yannick42.github.io/dsa-tests/spreadsheet/

# Snake game in JS
> https://yannick42.github.io/dsa-tests/snake/

it reuses the toposort algorithm (DFS in `/common/`) to order neuron calculations

@TODO
- be able to run a game without canvas visualization
- visualize timings
- be able to play multiple games quickly
- trace the gain / find a cost function to assess fitness
- ... ?
